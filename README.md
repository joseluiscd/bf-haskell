# BF-Haskell
Haskell implementation of a brainf**k compiler.
This is my first "big" Haskell project, and I've written it to learn this language.

I thought writing a BF interpreter was a good idea, and it helped me understanding Monads
and Monad-Transformers better.

Parser was written from scratch, without Parsec library.
